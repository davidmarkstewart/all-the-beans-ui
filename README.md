# All The Beans UI

## Tools Used

### Vue 3
Decided to use Vue as it's a framework I have previous experience with and has a low learning curve to get back into.

### TypeScript
Went with TypeScript as it adds a level of compile-time safety.

### Vite
Used Vite as it does a lot of initial project setup and provides a good all-round development experience.

### Pinia
Pinia for state management. Probably overkill for a small project.

### Vue Router
Vue Router for navigation.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS for styling. Writing CSS from scratch can be a pain. I really like the utility class style of writing CSS.

### Vitest
Vitest for unit tests. I like its simplicity, but Jest would be just as suitable.
